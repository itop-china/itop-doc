*   **标准门户** 如果用户允许从这个控制台切换到门户，能看到提供的这个菜单。
    
    *   _如果iTop安装了其他的门户，并且对于当前用户可用，它们也将同时在这里显示。_
        
*   **首选项** 帮助用户管理在应用的首选项（语言、显示设置、快捷方式、关心的组织，等等）。
    
*   **注销** 终端iTop会话。

### 标准门户
---------------

See [Portal User Guide](https://www.itophub.io/wiki/page?id=3_0_0:portal:portal_v2 "3_0_0:portal:portal_v2") for how to use the iTop User Portal, which is another iTop interface, simplified, targeted for clients and end-users as a self-service portal.

User Preferences
----------------

See next chapter for [managing your preferences](https://www.itophub.io/wiki/page?id=3_0_0:user:user_preference "3_0_0:user:user_preference")

Disconnecting from iTop
-----------------------

[![Log-off screen](https://www.itophub.io/wiki/media?w=300&tok=045c66&media=3_0_0:user:logoff-screen.png "Log-off screen")](https://www.itophub.io/wiki/media?media=3_0_0:user:logoff-screen.png "3_0_0:user:logoff-screen.png") [![Log-off menu](https://www.itophub.io/wiki/media?w=300&tok=49054e&media=3_0_0:user:logoff-menu.png "Log-off menu")](https://www.itophub.io/wiki/media?media=3_0_0:user:logoff-menu.png "3_0_0:user:logoff-menu.png")

*   Select the menu
    
*   then you get a confirmation message, which allow you to connect again
    

An alternate way to close your iTop session is to close your web browser. Note that closing only the “tabs” or windows showing iTop pages but keeping the web browser open is not sufficient to terminate your session with iTop. The session will be kept open until the last window is closed.

Changing your password
----------------------

[![Change Password dialog](https://www.itophub.io/wiki/media?w=300&tok=015763&media=3_0_0:user:change-pwd.png "Change Password dialog")](https://www.itophub.io/wiki/media?media=3_0_0:user:change-pwd.png "3_0_0:user:change-pwd.png") Click on the **_Change Password_** menu item, to display the change password form:

*   Type your `old password` in the **Old password** field.
    
*   Next, in the **New password** field below, type the new password.
    
    *   There can be password complexity rule defined by your iTop administrator,
        
    *   By default it's more than 8 characters, with at least one digit, one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter and one special character.
        
    *   _The complexity rule is checked on new password only so your old password might not have been compliant._
        
*   Retype the new password in the third field.
    
*   When this is done, click **_Change Password_** to validate your change.
    

The **Change Password** menu item is not present when using an external mechanism to authenticate with iTop (such as LDAP, Active Directory, or a Single-Sign-On authentication). In this case you should use your usual method to manage your password.

About iTop
----------

Provides the iTop version you are using

[![](https://www.itophub.io/wiki/media?w=400&tok=d1aeb6&media=3_0_0:user:about-itop-user.png)](https://www.itophub.io/wiki/media?media=3_0_0:user:about-itop-user.png "3_0_0:user:about-itop-user.png")

The Menu bar
============

On the left of the screen, a expendable bar contains the **Menus** for the application. This is the entry point to most iTop features.

[![Menu bar expended ](https://www.itophub.io/wiki/media?w=180&tok=464850&media=3_0_0:user:menubar-expanded2.png "Menu bar expended ")](https://www.itophub.io/wiki/media?media=3_0_0:user:menubar-expanded2.png "3_0_0:user:menubar-expanded2.png")

The menus groups include icons and can be shrunk to display just the icons, thus gaining space for the valuable information

Welcome
-------

A quick way to go back to iTop homepage!

*   A click on this logo [![](https://www.itophub.io/wiki/media?w=40&tok=11b32f&media=3_0_0:user:welcome-icon.png)](https://www.itophub.io/wiki/media?media=3_0_0:user:welcome-icon.png "3_0_0:user:welcome-icon.png") will bring you back to iTop homepage, by default it is the Welcome dashboard!
    

Expand & Collapse
-----------------

[![Collapsed menus and filtered organization ](https://www.itophub.io/wiki/media?w=300&tok=922a53&media=3_0_0:user:menubar-filtered-on-organization.png "Collapsed menus and filtered organization ")](https://www.itophub.io/wiki/media?media=3_0_0:user:menubar-filtered-on-organization.png "3_0_0:user:menubar-filtered-on-organization.png")

*   Use the hamburger icon [![Expending menu icon](https://www.itophub.io/wiki/media?w=30&tok=cbb519&media=3_0_0:user:menubar-expand-icon.png "Expending menu icon")](https://www.itophub.io/wiki/media?media=3_0_0:user:menubar-expand-icon.png "3_0_0:user:menubar-expand-icon.png") to expand and collapse the first level of menus.
    
*   When the menubar is expended, it displays a text along with the group icons.
    
*   To collapse the menubar, press the [![> sign](https://www.itophub.io/wiki/media?w=30&tok=fd7c80&media=3_0_0:user:menubar-expanded-icon.png "> sign")](https://www.itophub.io/wiki/media?media=3_0_0:user:menubar-expanded-icon.png "3_0_0:user:menubar-expanded-icon.png") icon.
    
*   When the menubar is collapsed, a red circle is displayed [![Filtered menu collapse icon](https://www.itophub.io/wiki/media?w=30&tok=c4af09&media=3_0_0:user:menubar-filtered-on-organization-icon.png "Filtered menu collapse icon")](https://www.itophub.io/wiki/media?media=3_0_0:user:menubar-filtered-on-organization-icon.png "3_0_0:user:menubar-filtered-on-organization-icon.png") if you have filtered on an organization.

Opening one Menu group
----------------------

When you click on a menu group icon or title, it opens a second bar of menus with all the sub-menus of that group. [![Count in query menus](https://www.itophub.io/wiki/media?w=250&tok=c0dad9&media=3_0_0:user:menubar-second-level.png "Count in query menus")](https://www.itophub.io/wiki/media?media=3_0_0:user:menubar-second-level.png "3_0_0:user:menubar-second-level.png") For the sub-menus which are of type predefined queries, then the number of objects returned by the query is displayed:

*   Exact number of objects when the result is below 100,
    
*   Otherwise `99+` is displayed, indicating that they are more than 99, but for performance reason, the exact count has not been performed.
    

Search in menus
---------------

[![Search in Menus](https://www.itophub.io/wiki/media?w=200&tok=ead4c4&media=3_0_0:user:menubar-searchmenu.png "Search in Menus")](https://www.itophub.io/wiki/media?media=3_0_0:user:menubar-searchmenu.png "3_0_0:user:menubar-searchmenu.png")

Maybe you know a particular sub-menu title, but you can't remember under which icon/main menu it is located.

*   Click on **any** menu group and see at the top of the column which just appeared, the grey filter zone
    

*   Then enter some characters to filter the menus containing that string
    
*   A **white-space** character, displays **all** menus
    

*   select in the filtered list of menus, the one you want
    

A shorter way to do this just using the keyboard is to

1.  Press `Alt+M` on Chrome to search in menus without the mouse (You can change this shorcut keys in your user preference, as it collapse with a Firefox shortcut for eg.)
    
2.  Enter part of the searched menu name
    

* * *

Organizations
-------------

Many of the objects managed in iTop belong to an _Organization_. Organizations are the main means to arrange objects in iTop. For example the access control is based on Organizations: a given user may be allowed to access only a given set of Organizations. Moreover the **Organizations Selection** menu at the top of the menu allows the end-user to limit the current display to the context of the given Organization. Once an Organization is selected, this “context” information is kept from page to page. To reset the context and display again all iTop objects, simply select “All Organizations” in the drop-down list.

If the list of all possible Organizations is too long (more than 50), then the drop-down list is replaced by an **auto-complete**. In this case just type at least three letters of the name of an Organization to select it. If you are unsure about the naming, use the **magnifying glass** icon to search for Organizations.

Depending on your access rights in iTop, you may not have access to some Organizations. In this case, the _forbidden_ Organizations are not listed in the drop-down box, and the objects belonging to these Organizations are not accessible to you either.

It is sometimes desirable to shorten the list of Organizations displayed in the drop-down box. For instance, you may need to view only your customers of interest. Refer to [Managing your preferences](https://www.itophub.io/wiki/page?id=3_0_0:user:user_preference "3_0_0:user:user_preference") for more information about how to configure the list.
